# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
This analysis contains the total rides, drivers, and fares of three different community types (Urban, Suburban and rural) in the year 2019, as well as the average fare per ride and per driver. It also contains a look at the total fares per week from the months of January to April. Its purpose is to provide an explicit look at ride share usage and success in different living environments.
## Results
When looking at the data there is a heavy saturation of ride share driveers in urban settings leading to a lower fare on average. However, there are more rides occuring in urban settings that offsets the cheaper fares making urban areas the most successful in terms of fare totals. In rural communities there are significantly less ride shares and drivers than those in the urban communities leading to higher fares and less app usage. Rural and Suburban fares have a higher average fare per driver than average fare per ride. The opposite is true for urban cities with a higher average fare per ride and lower average fare per driver
## Summary
### Ideas for improving PyBer usage
* In order to offset the number of drivers in urban settings the company must increase the number of riders via adverstisemnt or another incentive such as frequent user discounts. 
* A driver end of year bonus based on number of miles driven may insentivise drivers working in rural communities
* A notification system that advertises to customers to use PyBer for traveling and notifies drivers about the busiest weeks so that they can be out and driving.
